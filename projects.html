				<p>
					<img style="float:right" src="images/JellyRacer_Trailer.gif" alt="Short Demo of SWL List Builder" height="150px" />
					In this Game a team of developers and I were tasked with creating a game for P1-OM over the course of 8 days. What we
					ended up creating was a game where you race around a track attempting to get the best score possible while collecting
					berries. A list of our specific contributions can be found in the credits option on the main menu.
					We have a trailer for this game so please take a listen to one of our sound designers songs while seeing a basic showcase
					of our gameplay if you wish!
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qItYf1iCzE0">TRAILER</a> Here is a link to a build for the game:

				<h2>Ice Guy</h2>
				<h3>2D Platformer Game - Game Maker</h3>
				<p>
					<img style="float:right" src="images/IceGuyGamePlay.gif" alt="Gameplay of ICE GUY" height="150px" />
					Ice Guy is a game that 2 other programmers and I developed where you play as an Ice Cube guy that needs to avoid the sunlight so that he does not die.
					He must do this while platforming his way to the end of the level. This game was created in Game Maker with all custom sprites. This was my first game
					that Ideveloped with a group of other developers and one of the first games that I ever developed. However this current build is not the final build
					because I have been unable to reach those people, it does have enough there to give you the idea of what the game was ment to be. You can download the
					game here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJfvln1ETpUs7zfb5qx8qTy9hl8JS0kH/view?usp=sharing">DOWNLOAD</a>!

					<h2>Dungeon Designer</h2>
					<h3>Online Sandbox Level Designer - Unity</h3>
					<p>
						<img style="float:right" src="images/DungeonDesigner.PNG" alt="Picture of Gameplay of Dungeon Designer" height="150px" />
						Dungeon Designer was a game made to allow players to create and share dungeons. They can then play through either theirs or a fiends dungeon.
						This game was more of a proof of concept rather than a full game because I did not add any enemies into the game and just put chests and little target
						dummies. The hope was to then take this and continue working on it into the future and adding enemies. This did not end up happeneing because I was burnt
						out at the end of this. You can download and take a look at the game however, the game will not work because I took down the servers a while ago.You can download the
						game here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10SpnzzMzwwFxFGdWhSil-E915XPL3h_t/view?usp=sharing">DOWNLOAD</a>!

					<h2>Experiment on AI</h2>
					<h3>Experimental Use of AI - Unity</h3>
					<p>
						<img style="float:right" src="images/ExperimentGameplay.gif" alt="Experiment Showcase" height="150px" />
						This is less of a game but more an experiement that I decided to mess with. As you can see in the video attached, there are green spots which is food. These green spots
						hold a positive weight which will attract the jellies to it. This is usedto represent food. Then when the jellies are killed, the create a slowly spreading area
						of negative weight(The red blobs). This is to represent the fear they have of the area a jelly was killed in. The jelly will compare weights in the surrounding area of the
						jellys position. If any of the areas around the jelly has a lower wieght, the jelly will move to it. It continues to check 3 times every second. You can download the
						game here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16IS91PrA_mdjPODr8yiGhjV6boCkiihc/view?usp=sharing">DOWNLOAD</a>!

					<h2>Star Wars Legion List Builder</h2>
					<h3>Table Top List Builder - WPF Forms</h3>
					<p>
						<img style="float:right" src="images/SWLAB_Play.gif" alt="Short Demo of SWL List Builder" height="150px" />
						In this application, you are able to create an account and share lists for the table top game Star Wars Legion.
						You can create an account and share lists with a given name. You are restricted to the max units for each type and you are limited
						by the points cap for the game. It stores these lists/profiles in an AWS SQL database.  Unfortunetly I have deleted the database so the
						app will no longer work but you can take a look at the code here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16IS91PrA_mdjPODr8yiGhjV6boCkiihc/view?usp=sharing">DOWNLOAD</a>!
